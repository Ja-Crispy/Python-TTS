# Python-TTS
A small TTS program made in Python, with a rudimentary UI.

gTTS was used as the first TTS engine, but using the program repeatedly resulted in failure as the code didn't have permission to delete the speech.mp3 file generated.

Therefore, pyttsx3 was used as an alternative. It proved to be much easier to use repeatedly, and was faster too.

# Libraries required
Run the following commandss in terminal to install the required librariess

```
pip install pyttssx3
pip install tkinter
pip install gTTS
pip install playsound
```
